# C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

This project focuses on concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. You will learn about manipulating data using pointers, working with arrays, and handling strings effectively.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of pointers and how to use them
- Work with arrays and understand their behavior
- Differentiate between pointers and arrays
- Manipulate strings and perform string-related operations
- Gain knowledge about the scope of variables in C programming

## Project Details

**Author:** Julien Barbier

**Project Start:** August 21, 2023, 4:00 AM

**Project End:** August 22, 2023, 4:00 AM

**Auto Review:** An automated review will be launched at the deadline.

## Concepts Covered

- Pointers and arrays
- Data Structures

## Resources

You are encouraged to read or watch the following resources to gain a better understanding of the concepts covered in this project:

- C - Arrays
- C - Pointers
- C - Strings
- Memory Layout

## Requirements

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- Files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty coding style. You can use `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl` for checking.
- Avoid using global variables
- Limit to a maximum of 5 functions per file
- Avoid using standard library functions like printf, puts, etc.
- You can use `_putchar` as needed
- Prototypes of functions and `_putchar` should be included in the `main.h` header file
- Push your header file to the repository

## Tasks

This project is composed of several tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of pointers, arrays, and strings. Each task has its own C files and main files for testing. The tasks include:

1. **98 Battery st.**: Write a function that updates the value a pointer points to.
2. **Don't swap horses in crossing a stream**: Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. **This report, by its very length, defends itself against the risk of being read**: Write a function that returns the length of a string.
4. **I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them**: Write a function that prints a string to stdout.
5. **I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear**: Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
6. **Half the lies they tell about me aren't true**: Write a function that prints every other character of a string.
7. **Winning is only half of it. Having fun is the other half**: Write a function that prints half of a string.
8. **Arrays are not pointers**: Write a function that prints elements of an array of integers.
9. **strcpy**: Write a function that copies a string to a buffer.

Each task has its corresponding C files and main files for testing. Make sure to compile the code according to the provided instructions and check the expected output.
